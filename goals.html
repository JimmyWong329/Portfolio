        <h2>Where Iâ€™m Headed</h2>
        <p>My long-term career goals is to be highly competent in the domain of computer engineering, especially in artificial intelligence and machine learning, or high-level computing systems, so that in the end, contributions can be established towards innovations meant for accomplishing more ease with technology in various fields. I was born and raised in the countryside, where land and nature were key factors in livelihood. My mother had her garden, and I spent an awful lot of time with her while she tended it with her hands: planting, watering, and harvesting. I can recall the work it took to measure out just the right amount of water for each plant to protecting them against vermin and diseases. Still, as much as one was committed, it often felt like there should be a better way to increase efficiency and lighten the severity of manual labor.

It was from watching my mother that a curiosity was sparked about how technology could make farming more productive and sustainable. I started to think, how might AI be applied in farming: precision planting, smart automated watering systems, or even advanced methods of harvesting. These thoughts blossomed from my early experiences, wherein one could see how much human effort was involved in growing food and how small-scale farmers usually had to struggle to sustain good yields without wastage of resources.

The application of technology in agriculture became very close to my heart. I then realized the role of AI in bringing a transformation in the way farming was being done: efficient and truly sustainable. AI-assisted systems would liberate farmers-mostly in rural set-ups-to automate, be more environmentally friendly, and increase yields. This would facilitate the small-scale farms where I grew up with high-tech solutions without requiring costly machinery or extreme measures. This is something I want to see materialize so that the next generation of farmers can do well by taking good care of the planet.
            I will create a foundation with core course completion in mathematics, programming, and computer science, followed by more advanced classes in artificial intelligence, neural networks, data science, and machine learning algorithms. These classes will form a solid technical basis on which to understand complex systems, analyze data, and develop predictive models driving innovation.

Concomitant with this course work, I would like to get hands-on experience through internships in AI and machine learning application companies, dealing with robotics, data analysis, or automation. Practical experience will be able to give me the opportunity to apply theoretical concepts in real-life scenarios, refine my problem-solving skills, and learn from the pros. Another important next step in this regard would be to churn out skills in software development: proficient skills in diverse programming languages like Python, C++, and Java; develop broad-skilled abilities in machine learning libraries and tools, including but not limited to TensorFlow and PyTorch.

Further than this, I would like to be involved in university research opportunities, especially those related to the applications of machine learning in healthcare or environmental science. Research projects will give me an opportunity to contribute to advanced development and work closely with professors and peers who love innovation as much as I do. Not only that, but I also hope to take part in hackathons, conferences, and other related student organizations for continued updating of my knowledge base, skills, and professional network.</p>
        <h3>Timeline</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Year 1: First-year courses will be completed that give solid grounding in the basics of computer science and mathematics, including introductory courses in programming languages such as Python and C++, Data Structures, and Algorithms. I would like to participate in student clubs about engineering and technology to get to know fellow students with similar interests and to be able to listen to guest speakers from the industry. Networking events and conferences, with much emphasis on artificial intelligence and machine learning, help me understand current trends and challenges within the field. I am also looking to seek out research opportunities with professors on topics related to AI or computer engineering for the greater exposure of doing research. Of course, mentorship will be of paramount importance, and I will communicate with professors and advanced students for advice on academic and career issues, in such a way enabling me to find my place in my future career and explore all areas of computer engineering. Also, considering the experience with my mother's garden from my childhood, I won't forget the idea of using technologies to raise farming to a brand-new level of efficiency.
                I will look into the application of AI in sustainable agriculture, whereby, through this experience, my long-term goals are shaped and, at the same time, I feel motivated to make technology meet real-life applications one way or another.</li>
            <li>Year 2: Take second-year intermediate courses in computer engineering, including Operating Systems, Computer Organization, and an Introduction to Artificial Intelligence. These will further develop the base I formed in Year 1 with more in-depth insight into how computer systems work and also into AI applications across domains. I'll start working on some personal projects regarding AI or machine learning, too. I may use Kaggle or GitHub to showcase my work and apply some of the classroom theory to real-world problems. I will continue to seek opportunities where I can participate in open-source projects that deal with AI, thus further honing my practical skills in the process.
                Coming from a background where one grew up helping in the garden, I will be looking at ways through which AI can be applied in agriculture: optimizing irrigation systems, precision planting, and management of crops. This summer, I will secure an internship in the professional world-preferably a company dealing in AI or software development-whereby one could take an active part in current projects and interact with people within the same field. It will help in filling the gap between theoretical learning and practical application and building networks within the technological sphere.

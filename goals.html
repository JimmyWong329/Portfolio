        <h2>Where I’m Headed</h2>
        <p>My long-term aspiration is to be highly competent in the domain of computer engineering, especially in artificial intelligence and machine learning, or high-level computing systems, so that in the end, contributions can be established towards innovations meant for accomplishing more ease with technology in various fields. I will create a foundation with core course completion in mathematics, programming, and computer science, followed by more advanced classes in artificial intelligence, neural networks, data science, and machine learning algorithms. These classes will form a solid technical basis on which to understand complex systems, analyze data, and develop predictive models driving innovation.

Concomitant with this course work, I would like to get hands-on experience through internships in AI and machine learning application companies, dealing with robotics, data analysis, or automation. Practical experience will be able to give me the opportunity to apply theoretical concepts in real-life scenarios, refine my problem-solving skills, and learn from the pros. Another important next step in this regard would be to churn out skills in software development: proficient skills in diverse programming languages like Python, C++, and Java; develop broad-skilled abilities in machine learning libraries and tools, including but not limited to TensorFlow and PyTorch.

Further than this, I would like to be involved in university research opportunities, especially those related to the applications of machine learning in healthcare or environmental science. Research projects will give me an opportunity to contribute to advanced development and work closely with professors and peers who love innovation as much as I do. Not only that, but I also hope to take part in hackathons, conferences, and other related student organizations for continued updating of my knowledge base, skills, and professional network.</p>
        <h3>Timeline</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Year 1: Laying strong foundations in computer science and mathematics by finishing introductory courses in programming, such as Python and C++, data structures, and algorithms. Be an active participant in student clubs that deal with engineering and technology; attend networking events; and look into the research opportunities available. Seek mentorship from professors and upperclassmen to guide me academically and in my career goals.</li>
            <li>Year 2:  Enroll in intermediate courses in computer engineering, such as operating systems, computer organization, and an introductory course in artificial intelligence. Begin working on personal projects related to AI or machine learning to apply what I’m learning in the classroom. Secure an internship for the summer, ideally with a company focused on AI or software development, to gain hands-on experience in a professional environment.

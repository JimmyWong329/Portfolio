        <h2>Project Title</h2>
        <p>
At Georgia Tech, we’re all about bringing tech to life, which is why I'm excited to present my project, “Smart Glasses with Integrated Display.” This wearable tech is designed to let users see digital info—like notifications or simple text—right within their eyeglasses, all without blocking their natural view. Think of it as augmented vision on a sleek, everyday scale, bridging digital content with real-world interactions in a way that feels effortless. This could be a game-changer for both daily life and professional settings, where staying connected matters.

My goal here is to develop a prototype that’s compact, lightweight, and as inconspicuous as possible, using accessible materials. I’m focusing on a small, clear display embedded within the lens, paired with a user interface that delivers just the essentials—no overwhelming streams of data, just what’s needed. 
            The experience would be like taking a quick look at your phone screen, but without the phone, right in your line of sight, hands-free.</p>

        <p>Technical Details of the Smart Glasses Project: The ESP32 microcontroller is the backbone of this project because this supports wireless connectivity and low power operation, making it fit for wearable technology. With its onboard Bluetooth, the ESP32 enables seamless communication with a smartphone or any other device so that notifications, texts, and all forms of digital information can show up on the glasses. It is also versatile on the development side, supporting both Arduino IDE and MicroPython. The ESP32 will have enough capability in terms of processing power and RAM to handle the display functions efficiently for a smooth and responsive user experience.

0.96" 128x64 OLED Display

The project's high-contrast OLED display is compact and has a visual output suited to wearable applications. A 0.96-inch screen connected to the ESP32 using I2C minimizes pin utilization, reducing the number of wires in the wiring setup. Its monochromatic and high-resolution design makes it ideal for displaying UIs like notifications and battery status. Using Adafruit GFX and SSD1306 libraries, users have full capability to display customized text and icons with clear, smooth transitions.

LiPo Rechargeable Battery

Both the ESP32 and the OLED display are powered by a rechargeable Lithium Polymer (LiPo) battery that allows it to be wirelessly portable. In application, the low-power features of the ESP32 are matched with the battery type, allowing for very extensive operational times, perfect for wearables. Recharge the battery easily via USB and, efficiently handle power to the ESP32 for very efficient battery life.

3D-Printed Mount

The OLED screen is attached to the glasses frame using a customized 3D-printed mount, positioned at an angle of 30 degrees for better visibility. This works particularly effectively with dark-lensed sunglasses, which reduce the ambient light and enhance clarity. The design should be comfortable for the user; hence, the display should be lightweight and unobtrusive in the field of view.

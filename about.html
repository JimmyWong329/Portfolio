        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Jordon Munoz, a first-generation college student majoring in computer engineering at the prestigious Georgia Institute of Technology. 
            I grew up at a small town in Georgia, where my curiosity for how things work led me to explore everything from taking apart a small electronic radio to learning basic Python syntax. 
        Now, at Georgia Tech, I'm making dreams into reality, surrounded by cutting edge technology. As a boy from a small town in Georgia, I never would have imagined having access to such opportunities, so this is truly a great chance for me. </p>
        <p>Some of my hobbies include day trading in the stock market, soccer, Brawl Stars(mobile game), finding engnieering projects to do. </p>
